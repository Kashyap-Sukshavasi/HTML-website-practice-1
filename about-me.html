    <p>
        Hi, I'm Kashyap and you visited this page probably because you wanted to know
        about me. I'm a 13 year old student living in Ontario, Canada. While being born in 
        India, I had the opportunity to live in a few countries such as Singapore, India, and
        Canada. Recently I've been involved in programming, and have grown a fan of it.
        I would like to pursue software development, and I'm advancing day-by-day.
        <br/><br/>
        I've been learning Python, HTML & CSS. I started of with a simple drag and drop language like Scratch
        and started to advance when I grew my interest in programming. Slowly and steadily, I've been learning
        Python, and other languages.
    </p>
