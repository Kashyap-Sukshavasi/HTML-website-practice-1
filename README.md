# HTML-website-practice-1
This is the first edition of my HTML practice, and on my account I will be documenting several test websites in order to advance in front-end development.
As you see, I'm using a very high percentage of HTML and less than 5% of CSS, because I have yet to learn about CSS, and you can find out about my progress in future 
repositories.

This repository is complete, but if you would like to recommend anythingh, please feel free to put up a pull request
